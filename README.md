##pymfinder

pymfinder is Python package with which to find network motifs in complex networks and to analyze a growing list of network-motif related stuff.

At its core, pymfinder is a Python library that combines Python methods for network-motif analysis. pymfinder will require you to have the Python modules Numpy and Setuptools installed in your machine. In addition, some of the engine underneath is a modified version of original mfinder version 1.2 written in C and available on Uri Alon's website. mfinder is a software tool for network-motif detection developed by Nadav Kashtan, and it was originally written in C and made available solely as an executable. We use mfinder within pymfinder for its underlying efficiency. The mfinder code has been both included and modified here with the explicit consent of Nadav Kashtan, the author of mfinder 1.2.

If you use pymfinder or the ideas presented in it, please remember to cite Bramon Mora, et. al. 2018.
